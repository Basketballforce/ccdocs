2.4.2
--------------
**Preface:**

Important hotfixes - don't skip updating to this one. Stat Exp was completely broken(in a bad way) and not yielding the correct vales at all.

**Fixes:**
 - Fixed Fef's last party member text missing a space after the species name.
 - Fixed setting a custom nickname palette from the Dex not capitalizing the internal entry.
 - Fixed Stat Exp badge check screwing up everything.
