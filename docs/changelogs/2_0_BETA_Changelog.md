## COMMUNITY PREFACE
For those of you who have no clue what's been going on, this
section's for you.

Recently the Crystal Clear community was hit with a wave of attention, which sorta set off a chain reaction where it continued to get even more attention. Being a small community of 800 or so, we weren't prepared for or expecting *literally thousands of people* flooding in, and we had to take measures to keep things from getting out of hand. This included taking down the site, and temporarily closing the discord. This caused a lot of confusion, problems, and lashing out at the wrong people, but we were trying to preserve CC's future.

With the added stress and demand, and the decline of my own personal situation, progress slowed down immensely. To get a meaningful release out in a reasonable timeframe, this meant 2.0 dropped down to being "2.0 BETA." It's not my exact vision for the big update, with less than I wanted, but the core engine of followers is done, with a full set of text and plenty to expand upon in future updates. I was also able to squeeze in a lot more bonus material than I was expecting, thanks to the efforts of the patrons and a few other people pitching in.

So with that in mind, here's **2.0 BETA!** It is an ambitious update, and definitely comes with some free bugs.

## FOLLOWER UPDATE
![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image2.png)

#### Usage:
 - On the party screen, press **SELECT** on the desired party member to set follower
	* This is not limited to first party slot
 - Marked by an **F** (out of the ball) or a **ball icon** (in the ball under certain circumstances) + matching SFX
 - Followers that are fainted, frozen, or asleep won't be allowed out of the ball
 - EGGS can be set as followers, but won't follow you until they hatch

![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image5.png)
 - Bill's PC/Daycare handling
	 * will remember the follower if it remains in the party
	 * otherwise it will select the same slot, or the last conscious party member
 
 - Followers will gain happiness at 1.5x the rate of the rest of the party when walking with the player

#### Sprites/Palettes:
 - Use proper species palette, basically meaning instead of a default color, it's the actual species palette.
 - Dynamically modified based on time of day

![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image21.png)
 - Certain species will load a custom palette combination if their design calls for it
	 * For example, Crobat's colors are purple and blue, but looks better with white eyes and a purple body.
 - Full set of 251 walking sprites, including every Unown letter
	 * Many non-follower overworld NPCs now walk around
	 * If a Swinub knows whirlwind, it will have an alternate overworld sprite.
 - "Where?" Flying menu now uses the walking sprite and proper palette

![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image4.png)
 - Any compatible NPC OW species now use their correct palettes too
	 * This includes the daycare, which thanks to dynamic palette shuffling, alway use the correct palettes for both species, including shiny status.
	 * Certain maps can't support this palette system, so some species will use default palettes.

![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image20.png)

#### Animations:
 - Overworld
	 * Certain species will smoothly hover/fly behind the player

![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image6.gif)
 - Return/release ball animations during certain events (biking, certain cutscenes, etc.)

![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image13.gif)
 - Surf - If the follower knows surf, it takes priority for surfing
	 * Moves under player before the player gets on it to surf
	 * Has different SFX for exiting water
	 * Surfing party member is remembered (pitfall onto water, menu, etc.)

![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image11.gif)
 - Pitfall - if you fall into a pit, the follower will dash after you! and then fall into the hole as well
	 * Hovering Species will have a different animation/SFX when falling from the pits
 - Ice - Ice type followers don't slide on ice, and neither do hovermon
 - Cut/Headbutt/Rock Smash - follower will attack the object in question, with SFX
 - Teleport - You and the follower will spin into the air
 - Dig - You and the follower will spin into the ground
 - Fly - The follower will move into you before flying away with you
 - The follower jumps up onto the desk for the Center healing animation

![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image17.gif)
 - After a certain amount of time without moving, the follower will idly look around

#### In battle:
 - The follower will slide in and out, instead of coming out from its ball
 - Certain enemy trainers that have "followers" will also have them slide in and out

![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image8.gif)

#### Movement:
 - Follower
	 * Player doesn't collide with follower
	 * Follower walks in place
	 * Always tries to face the player(HGSS doesn't even do this, but Yellow did)
	 * Supports ledge jumping (had to add a fast jump and hyper jump animation) + new SFX (+ alt sfx for hovermon)
	 * Follower is hidden when under the player while going through a door or spawning

 - Certain species like Weezing have code to keep their sprites from flipping on the X axis
 
 - If the follower is between you and an enemy trainer, the follower will walk beneath the player to a safe spot (compared to HGSS, which doesn't let the trainer spot you, which makes no sense)

![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image12.gif)

#### Interactions:
 - Priority system
	 * Certain conditions will cause the follower to react accordingly, like low HP or a status condition.
	 * The last interaction is saved, so you'll never get the same interaction twice in a row
 
 - Recent Events
	 * The follower is paying attention to what you do! Many NPCs and overworld events have corresponding text.
 
 - Caught Location
	 * Your follower knows when it's home.
 
 - Species
	 * Lots of text has been written by the patrons based on the Dex entries. Every species is different!
 
 - Traded OTID
	 * Your follower remembers where it came from. Maybe it misses its original trainer from time to time?
 
 - Shiny
	 * Huh? Did PIGY just sparkle a little bit?
 
 - Current Map
	 * What's going on in the world around us?

![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image7.png) ![](images/2_0_BETA_Changelog/image10.png)
 - Tiles
	 * Huh? Did something rustle in the grass?

 - Type
	 * What would certain typed species be doing?
	 * Random between dual type species

 - Personality
	 * Every species is different, so what's this one like?

 - Time of day
	 * Is the follower excited to start its day, or is it ready for bed?

 - Moves
	 * TELEPORT has a random chance to bring back an item.
	 * HGSS: "...Oh? DITTO's appearance... Didn't change!" CC: ( ͡° ͜ʖ͡°)
 
 - Items
	 * If the follower isn't holding an item, there's a chance it'll pick one up!
	 * Certain species might even be better at finding certain items.
	 * Certain species that hold evolution stones might have a difficult time...
	 * PIGY is munching on the LEFTOVERS.
 
 - Squirtbottle can be used on the follower for a different reaction based on typing
 - Talk to the lady in New Bark Town with Lugia as your follower
 
 - Animations:
	 * Follower will hop around, look around, look away, etc. during certain interactions

 - Many more interactions and texts to discover!

 - Dynamically loading palettes meant almost all of the sprites required updates, which they received.
	 * This includes a new set of 26 individual Unown sprites!
 - Mail and Item icons are now static, and no longer cover the sprite

## SHINY/ROAMER HUNTING BUFFS
 - Fleeing species won't try to flee if they're shiny
	 * This does not apply to roaming legends, who will stay shiny even if they flee.

 - Can no longer run from any shiny, even with a Smoke Ball
	 * (not being able to run from shinies was originally limited to the red Gyarados)

*With the exception of Roar, the following roamer instances mostly apply to Mew's Metronome*

**Hi Jump Kick/Jump Kick:**
 - If a roamer or wild shiny misses, it won't take crash damage
 - "MEW kept going and landed safely!"

**Selfdestruct/Explosion:**

**Whirlwind/Roar/Teleport:**
 - Fails if used by a shiny

**Take Down/Double-Edge/Submission/Moves with Recoil:**

 - Fails if used by a wild shiny

**Struggle:**
 - Is handled slightly differently than the other recoil moves
 - Struggle will work normally until enemy HP is red
 - It will then fail until you're out of balls
 - When you're out of balls, it will resume working normally to prevent soft-locks
 - This is for weird instances like wild shiny Smeargle missing sketch
