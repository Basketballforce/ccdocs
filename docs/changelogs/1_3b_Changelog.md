Map fixes:
----------
*Cherrygrove Bay Cave B1F:*

 - Extra shortcut in case of getting stuck down near the water but over the ledges
	* This is only needed for users who traverse the cave without surf

 - Swapped forge entrance door with shortcut entrance door

New features:
-------------
 - Ported continuous repel from PC
 - Shiny egg now has blue spots (also ported from PC)
 - The current game version is printed on the start screen
	* This is to address multiple people not knowing what version they're on (likely due to Quick Continue)
