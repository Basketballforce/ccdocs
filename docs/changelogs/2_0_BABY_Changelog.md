## CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION

The biggest feature in this update is **character customization**  - you
can now pick out your **sprite, gender** and **any two colors that you
want.** Each character even has a preset palette option, and you can
choose from 3 default sets of skin tones and 3 default sets of colors.
There's also a full RGB editor with color values displayed, so you can
share or save your palette information for future runs, or tweak the
values to get them perfect. For those who are more adventurous,
randomization is also available!

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image12.png) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image21.png)

*The character editor is also available from the basement of the Goldenrod Department Store at any time.*

Added **NONE** as a gender option:
 - To preserve compatibility, this option defaults to male when creating caught data, however as long as the player's gender is set to none, no gender symbol will be displayed for species whose ID and OT match the player.

Added **BLUE, YELLOW,** and **LENA** (based off of a female capsule mon beta trainer) as playable characters.

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image23.png)

Added new pack design screen, allowing the player to pick up to **60** different custom bag designs, and **8** primary color schemes. You can change your bag style from the options menu at any time.

Certain bag designs are unlocked by events within the game, for a total of 22 different bag designs with multiple alternate colors for each!

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image38.png) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image11.png)

*See if you can figure out what some bags are references to!*

If this isn't enough customization for you, then I have good news. **We've developed an injection system for character sprites!** This includes support for a custom palette as well as the additional new features like enabling/disabling hair flipping.

But why stop at just characters? Many people have expressed a lot of interest in **injecting custom starters**, so we added that as well.
 - If there's an injected starter, pressing SELECT on the starter screen will load it.
 - If it has no set DVs, it'll randomize them (this also takes the extra shiny rerolls into account for SRing)
 - If no moves are set, it fills them in automatically.

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image17.png) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image14.png)

If you're interested in this, check out [Allen's combination injection and patching website](https://inject.fm1337.com/)

**Misc changes:**
 - Intro sequence no longer has a "default name" selection

## GAMEPLAY UPDATES
The entire Safari Zone now has an increased shiny encounter chance of **1/4096.**

Readded the Town Map as the **Region Map** item
 - Can be registered to select to easily check where you are without navigating through the start menu.
 - This will have some expanded functionality later, but for now it's just a helpful map!

Added **BLUEBELL**, and some other secret overworld encounters!

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image32.png) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image39.png)

Reimplemented Mystery Gift trainer data - any pre-existing data from previous saves should also work as well.

Added a Snorlax to National Park

Safari Zone Main Office trash can now has a **NUGGET** in it.

*TEAM ROCKET's hideout is in the basement of the GAME CORNER. Oh, wait. That was four years ago...*

## MOVE TUTOR UPDATES
**Reworked Kanto TM Tutor:**
 - Made space and extended compatibility, so it works the way it should have in the first place
 - Several missing entries including those for Gen 2 species were added
 - Can now scroll left and right through moves directly on the party screen to see full party compatibility at once
 - Can hold left/right to rapidly scroll through
 - Also applied these changes to the Event Move Tutor, *Battle Move Tutor*(see below), and the *Unown Shrine*(see below)

**Event Move Tutor** is now free to use!
 - Added some missing Dizzy Punch species from the Odd Egg to the Event Move Tutor

**Added Someone's PC/Grizz's PC:**
 - Available after meeting any of the move tutors, shows up as Grizz's PC after meeting him specifically
 - Can access any of the move tutor move sets and teach them from any PC.

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image16.png) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image40.png)

**Added the new Battle Tutor:**

**Grizz:** *"The Battle Tutor is me! Richard and I put our heads together and decided that more choices should be viable for both casual *and* competitive Crystal Clear gameplay. We harassed ShockSlayer until he agreed to join in our judging of what cool new moves should be handed out, adding spicy and powerful options to *more than 200 SPECIES!* I know every species is someone's favorite, and the Battle Tutor will make adventures with your favorites even better! Go out and use it to win some battles!"*

The Battle Tutor also fixes some issues where species could learn a GSC TM move only by breeding
 - For example, Krabby could be bred to learn Dig but was not compatible with the Dig TM.

**SS:** *This feature was also used to expand some HM compatibility. For example, if a species could learn SURF, it can now learn WHIRLPOOL and WATERFALL as well. However, to teach these moves, you must first have the required HM.*

Added **Unown Shrine** to Ruins Of Alph
 - This can be used to teach a few extra moves to Unown to increase their flexibility in general.

## QUALITY OF LIFE
**New DV viewer screen and handling:**
 - Pressing **SELECT** brings up the full DV Viewer:
	 * Shows the wild HP values, DVs, Hidden Power, Moves, PP, and Held Item icon

 - New options:
	 * **OFF** (displays nothing)
	 * **LITE** (old style HUD numbers)
	 * **FORCE** (automatically opens new DV vision screen on battle start)
	 * **ALL** (auto-opens the new screen and displays the old numbers)

**DVs are now printed on the nickname screen** (no DV viewer required!)

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image33.png) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image20.png)

**Reworked the Coin Vendor:**
 - Scroll with the D-pad to pick Coins by 1 or 10
 - Automatically selects max possible amount via filling the Coin Case, or emptying the wallet
 - Displays:
	 * Your current coins and money
	 * Amount of coins and how much
	 * How much you'll have when you're done!

**Can now fish while surfing!**

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image42.png) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image13.png)

**Stats screen updates**
 - Now displays what type of stats you're looking at
 - Can now press SELECT to scroll through Stats, Stat Exp, and Base Stats(new!)
 - Added displaying N64 buttons next to moves, as well as corresponding party member
 - Stats screen no longer waits for the cry to finish before allowing player to scroll

**Pressing SELECT on the Dex screen now toggles shininess**

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image15.png) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image25.png)

Ported "Press B to highlight RUN" from PolishedCrystal
 - This doesn't highlight run during trainer battles

Improved some SR loops to skip playing sound effects on every reset.

Moved BANK ACCOUNT to a new submenu when accessing the player's PC

Resetting the clock from the menu now immediately saves the new time, instead of requiring the player to enter the overworld and save again

Can now fly to the Mt. Moon Center directly

If the egg the daycare man is holding is shiny, he'll be distracted by the spots before facing the player

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image24.png) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image18.png)

Saying "No" to the Daycare man's egg now resets breeding properly

If it's not already released as shiny, Tin Tower rolls Suicune's DVs on map entry, and displays shininess accordingly

Added an extra signpost event to the left Gym statue in Fuchsia Gym for ease of rechallenging

Throwing a ball in PIGY/CHAMP battles now asks if you're sure you want to use it first.

When getting the Dex rated, Seen/Caught mon are re-evaluated
 - this can be done at any time, and fixes things like Stadium 2/PKHex not setting the correct Dex flags.

Magnet Train animation now waits to press A before finishing
 - This means the train can go faster, or you can take the scenic route with accompanying music.

Implemented handling for additional non-canon landmarks, allowing new areas to be seen on the map and display the landmark sign. This affects:
 - Viridian Forest
 - New Cinnabar Island
 - Safari Zone
 - Cerulean Cave
 - Grullo Gorge *(new to this update)*
 - Cherrygrove Bay
 - Forest Path *(new to this update)*
 - Rose Mountain *(new to this update)*
 - Forest Of Rage *(new to this update)*

## BALANCE CHANGES
**Reworked Route 16's wild data**
 - Levels have been reduced from 26-30 to 6-11
	 * This is to make it more viable for an early-game spot, and to differentiate it from Route 17 and 18 which are harder to get to, but have similar data
 - Slugma is now available at all times of day
 - Ditto can now be found here
 - Slugma can now be found at all times of day on Route 17 and 18, but is easier to find during the day.
 - Rewrote a Lass in Celadon to mention this area

**Kanto legendary birds no longer require 5 badges to appear in their respective locations**

Legendary birds, Sudowoodo, Celebi, Gyarados/Magikarp, Lapras, and Snorlax **now scale with badges.** Starting at level 5, adding 5 per badge, capping at level 60. *(this is higher than before for Lapras and Snorlax)*

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image7.png) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image19.png)

**Moveset updates:**
 - Legendary birds now always have FLY, and Zapdos always has ZAP CANNON
 - Goldenrod Game Corner Sneasel now gets CUT and SURF
 - Celadon Game Corner Heracross now gets CUT and STRENGTH
 - Extremespeed Dratini now gets WATERFALL
 - Red Gyarados now always has SURF, and is a Magikarp at lower levels. The overworld sprite reflects this...you'll have to look closely if you want an early Magikarp!

Moved a Voltorb over in the Power Plant to accommodate attempting to get an earlier Zapdos

Items are no longer permitted during E4 battles, and the E4 themselves no longer use items either.

Doubled Slot machine payouts, with the exception of 777 which instead of being doubled to 600 is now 777

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image35.png) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image1b.png)

Tweaked Champion's movesets and team order

Replace Beat Up on Blaine, Pryce, and Sabrina's teams with Pursuit, Bite, and Amnesia respectively

Added automatic move generation handling to replace Beat Up with Bite
 - This will only affect enemy trainer Sneasels

"THE CHAMP" now knows Metronome instead of Curse

**Nerfed Hall of Fame:**
 - Now only stores two teams; very first time famers and most recent famers
	* Text will reflect this instead of the old "\#-Time Famers"
 - Older save files will only display the last two recent teams, only overwriting the most recent
 - Entering the Hall of Fame 200 times will now properly display "HOF Master!" on the screen
 - This freed up 2744 bytes in SRAM, which have been planned for use in future updates.

## NEW TRAINERS
Many new trainers have been added to the overworld! Defeat them to receive a gift, gameplay hints, or simply for the challenge!

## PALETTE UPDATES
Along with the custom player palette, the entire object palette system has been reworked, with palettes being loaded per-map instead of a default set of 8. This allows us to push the boundaries of what the game is capable of and add a lot more color to the overworld, resulting in a lot of nice features listed below:
 - The player now has their own custom palette that can be modified at any time
 - Gym Leaders and other special characters have their own unique palettes
 - Overworld species now all have their correct palettes and aren't limited to 1 per map
 - Decorations now have the proper species palettes, along with some new ones
 - Rocks and other overworld objects can now have custom palettes again
 - The scratch palette is now no longer a shared palette except on a small handful of maps
	* this allows for things like the new overworld shiny animation! (see below)
 - The follower's palette handling was moved into this new system
	* this doesn't change much, but it did get a custom ball palette when it's returned/released

And most importantly, the NPCs and trainers across the overworld now use a dynamic palette building system, consisting of 16 different skin tones and and 16 different primary colors, for a total of 256 different color combinations, compared to the mere 6 colors from before. What's more, these color combinations are reflected in-battle, meaning no two trainers are alike!

**Other palette updates:**

Trainer card now has most Gym leaders reflecting their correct palettes

Trainer card now loads Gear palettes as the primary color

Catching tutorial dude now loads the Cooltrainer M palette

Overworld palettes now use the same Time of Day modification as followers did in 2.0 BETA

Kimono girls sprite colors now match the corresponding species

Added new Neph and SS in battle sprites

Added new hair to Honeybun's overworld sprites

Updated Chronicler Robert's overworld sprites to properly reflect his hair color

Updated Doom's battle sprites and improved his palette

![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image43.gif) ![](images/2_0_BABY_Changelog/image45.gif)

Added proper follower handling to Azalea Town for Dig and Escape rope
 - accounting for Ilex Forest return warp being sideways

Potential bug fix for offscreen standing sprites displaying glitched text/walking frames

Gave Ness a visibility event flag to fix him returning after his script when getting on and off the bike or respawning a follower
