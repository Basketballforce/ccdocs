2.5.1
--------------
**Preface:**

A handful of bugfixes, and some last minute Battle Tutor/Unown Shrine additions. The main reason to update is the handful of issues that were present with the 5 additional Nickname Palette slots in regards to the trade bot and mixed case nicknames not working properly.

I was also able to push things around enough to make room for a new easter egg with the Onix in Fuchsia City, after fixing its symmetrical but unfortunate disposition. That sidequest is now also outlined properly in the Dex.

**Fixes:**
 - After using transform, the appropriate nickname will also be mirrored. This fixes a bug when transforming into XD001.
 - Fixed non-slot 1 nicknames not being saved properly to the transfer system.
 - Fixed a spelling error in Goldenrod Cafe.
 - Fixed mixed case nicknames not displaying their status properly in the Dex's slot selection menu.
 - Fixed Fuchsia City Onix not using the correct movement data.
